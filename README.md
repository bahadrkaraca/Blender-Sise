# Blender Şişe Project

This repository contains the source files and assets for the "Blender Şişe" project. The project involves creating a 3D model of a bottle using Blender, focusing on realistic modeling, texturing, and rendering techniques.

## Project Overview

The "Blender Şişe" project aims to demonstrate the process of creating a detailed and realistic 3D model of a bottle. It covers various aspects of 3D design including modeling, texturing, and rendering within Blender.

## Features

- **3D Modeling:** Create an accurate and detailed 3D model of a bottle.
- **Texturing:** Apply realistic textures to the 3D model.
- **Rendering:** Use Blender's rendering capabilities to produce high-quality images of the bottle.

## Requirements

To work on this project, you'll need:

- Blender (version 2.8 or later)
- Basic knowledge of Blender for 3D modeling, texturing, and rendering

## Getting Started

To get started with the Blender Şişe project, follow these steps:
